                <p>Flowers are a gift to this earth. As Gerard De Nerval once said, “Every flower is a soul blossoming
                    in nature.” They paint contrasting colors along the ground and bring joy to many. Their elegance and
                    delicate touches have us all in awe and exhilaration.</p>

                    <h2>Cherry blossom</h2>
                    <p>The cherry blossom or sakura (桜 / さくら) is one of Japan’s biggest symbols. This beautiful flower typically blooms in pink and white, but depending on the variety, some trees carry yellow, green or dark pink petals! 

                        Hanami or cherry blossom viewing is a popular activity in spring. You and your colleagues or family can find a good spot under a canopy of pink and enjoy the sight while picnicking. A popular spot in Tokyo is along the Meguro River, which is lined with sakura trees. Sakura flavored Kit-Kat bars, cakes, drinks, and many more can be seen around Japan as well.
                        
                        Tourists and locals alike adore sakura so much that the Japan Meteorological Agency forecasts its blossoming throughout the country!

                    <h2>Sunflower</h2>
                    <p>Sunflowers are usually tall annual or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of 300 centimetres (120 inches) or more. Each "flower" is actually a disc made up of tiny flowers, to form a larger false flower to better attract pollinators. The plants bear one or more wide, terminal capitula (flower heads made up of many tiny flowers), with bright yellow ray florets (mini flowers inside a flower head) at the outside and yellow or maroon (also known as a brown/red) disc florets inside. Several ornamental cultivars of H. annuus have red-colored ray florets; all of them stem from a single original mutant.[11] While the majority of sunflowers are yellow, there are branching varieties in other colours including, orange, red and purple. The petiolate leaves are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, ovate, or often heart-shaped.</p>
